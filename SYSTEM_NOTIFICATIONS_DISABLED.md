# System Notifications Disabled

## Problem
The app was showing push notifications for system events like:
- User online/offline status changes
- Connection established/disconnected events
- Session registration events

These notifications were cluttering the notification tray and providing no value to users.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Disabled Presence Update Notifications

**File**: `lib/core/services/se_socket_service.dart`
**Location**: `presence:update` event handler (lines 887-888)

**Before**:
```dart
// Create notification for presence update (only if not silent)
final bool silent = decryptedData['silent'] ?? false;
if (!silent) {
  final bool isOnline = decryptedData['isOnline'] ?? false;
  await _createSocketEventNotification(
    eventType: 'presence:update',
    title: isOnline ? 'User Online' : 'User Offline',
    body: isOnline ? 'User came online' : 'User went offline',
    senderId: decryptedData['fromUserId']?.toString() ??
        decryptedData['sessionId']?.toString(),
    metadata: decryptedData,
    silent: silent,
  );
}
```

**After**:
```dart
// Skip notifications for presence updates (online/offline status)
Logger.debug('üü¢ SeSocketService: üîá Skipping notification for presence update (online/offline status)');
```

### 2. Disabled Session Registration Notifications

**File**: `lib/core/services/se_socket_service.dart`
**Location**: `session_registered` event handler (lines 377-378)

**Before**:
```dart
// Create notification for session registered
await _createSocketEventNotification(
  eventType: 'session_registered',
  title: 'Session Established',
  body: 'Real-time connection established successfully',
  metadata: data,
);
```

**After**:
```dart
// Skip notification for session registered (connection established)
Logger.debug('üîó SeSocketService: üîá Skipping notification for session_registered (connection established)');
```

### 3. Connection Events Already Disabled

**File**: `lib/core/services/se_socket_service.dart`
**Location**: `_createSocketEventNotification` method (lines 93-101)

Connection events were already being skipped:
```dart
// Skip notifications for connect/disconnect events
if (eventType == 'connect' ||
    eventType == 'disconnect' ||
    eventType == 'connect_error' ||
    eventType == 'reconnect' ||
    eventType == 'reconnect_failed') {
  Logger.debug(
      ' SeSocketService: üîá Skipping notification for connection event: $eventType');
  return;
}
```

## Events That Still Show Notifications

The following events will continue to show notifications as they are user-relevant:

### Key Exchange Events
- `key_exchange:request` - New key exchange request
- `key_exchange:response` - Key exchange response received
- `key_exchange:revoked` - Key exchange revoked
- `key_exchange:declined` - Key exchange declined
- `key_exchange:accept` - Key exchange accepted
- `key_exchange:error` - Key exchange error

### Message Events
- `message:received` - New message received (main notification)
- `message:deleted` - Message deleted
- `message:all_deleted` - All messages deleted
- `receipt:read` - Message read confirmation

### User Events
- `user_data_exchange:data` - User data exchange
- `user:deleted` - User deleted

### Contact Events
- `contacts:added` - Contact added
- `contacts:removed` - Contact removed

### Conversation Events
- `conversation:created` - New conversation created

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Notification Tray**: No more spam from system events
2. **Better User Experience**: Only relevant notifications are shown
3. **Reduced Notification Fatigue**: Users won't ignore important notifications
4. **System Events Still Logged**: All events are still logged for debugging
5. **Preserved Functionality**: All system functionality remains intact

## Technical Details

### What Was Changed
- **Presence notifications**: Completely disabled
- **Session registration notifications**: Completely disabled
- **Connection notifications**: Already disabled (no change needed)

### What Was Preserved
- **All event handling**: Events are still processed normally
- **Logging**: All events are still logged for debugging
- **Callbacks**: All callbacks are still executed
- **UI updates**: Presence and connection status still update the UI
- **Message notifications**: Still show for actual messages

### Debugging
System events are still logged with debug messages:
- `üü¢ SeSocketService: üîá Skipping notification for presence update (online/offline status)`
- `üîó SeSocketService: üîá Skipping notification for session_registered (connection established)`

## Expected Behavior

### Before Fix
- ‚ùå "User Online" notifications
- ‚ùå "User Offline" notifications  
- ‚ùå "Session Established" notifications
- ‚ùå "Connection Lost" notifications
- ‚úÖ Message notifications (working)

### After Fix
- ‚úÖ No presence status notifications
- ‚úÖ No connection status notifications
- ‚úÖ No session registration notifications
- ‚úÖ Message notifications still work
- ‚úÖ Key exchange notifications still work
- ‚úÖ Other user-relevant notifications still work

## Files Modified

### Primary Changes
- **`lib/core/services/se_socket_service.dart`**: Disabled presence and session notifications

### No Changes Needed
- **Connection notifications**: Already properly disabled
- **Other notification types**: Preserved as they are user-relevant

## Testing

### Verify Disabled Notifications
1. **Presence Changes**: User goes online/offline - no notification
2. **Connection Events**: App connects/disconnects - no notification
3. **Session Registration**: Session established - no notification

### Verify Working Notifications
1. **Messages**: Send message - notification appears
2. **Key Exchange**: Send key exchange request - notification appears
3. **Contacts**: Add/remove contact - notification appears

## Notes
- All system functionality remains intact
- Only the notification display is disabled
- Events are still processed and logged
- UI updates still work normally
- This improves user experience significantly
