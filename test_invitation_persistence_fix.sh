echo "üîß Testing Instructions:"
echo "1. Build and install the app:"
echo "   flutter build apk --debug && flutter install"
echo ""
echo "2. Test invitation persistence:"
echo "   - Send an invitation from another device/user"
echo "   - Verify it appears in the 'Received' tab"
echo "   - Navigate to a different screen (e.g., Chats)"
echo "   - Navigate back to Invitations screen"
echo "   - Verify the invitation is still there"
echo ""
echo "3. Expected debug output:"
echo "   - 'Loading invitations (merge local storage with Session contacts)...'"
echo "   - 'Found X invitations in storage'"
echo "   - 'Found Y Session contacts'"
echo "   - 'Loaded Z total invitations (local + Session contacts)'"
echo "   - 'Saved Z invitations to local storage for persistence'"
echo ""
echo "4. Expected behavior:"
echo "   - Invitations should persist when navigating between screens"
echo "   - Local storage invitations should be merged with Session contacts"
echo "   - No duplicate invitations should be created"
echo "   - All invitations should be saved to local storage for persistence"

echo "‚úÖ Invitation Persistence Fix Complete!"
echo ""
echo "Key fixes implemented:"
echo "- loadInvitations now merges local storage with Session contacts"
echo "- Duplicate prevention logic prevents overwriting existing invitations"
echo "- All invitations are saved to local storage for persistence"
echo "- Proper sorting ensures newest invitations appear at the top"
