# Black Screen Fix Summary

## Problem
After sending an invitation by adding a QR code image and hitting "Send Invite", the screen goes back and becomes black. The logs show WebSocket connection timeouts with SessionMessengerService.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by:
1. **WebSocket connection timeouts** - SessionMessengerService trying to connect to `wss://askless.strapblaque.com/ws` and timing out
2. **Blocking operations** - Connection attempts were blocking the UI thread
3. **Missing timeouts** - No timeout protection on invitation sending operations
4. **Poor error handling** - Errors in async operations weren't properly handled

## Solution

### 1. Fixed SessionMessengerService Connection Timeouts
**File**: `lib/core/services/session_messenger_service.dart`
**Changes**:
- Added proper timeout handling for the entire connection process
- Separated connection logic into `_performConnection()` method
- Added 10-second timeout for connection attempts
- Improved error handling to prevent UI blocking

### 2. Added Timeouts to AuthProvider
**File**: `lib/shared/providers/auth_provider.dart`
**Changes**:
- Added 5-second timeout to SessionMessengerService connection attempts
- Ensured connection failures don't block authentication process
- Applied timeout to both account creation and import flows

### 3. Enhanced Invite User Widget Error Handling
**File**: `lib/shared/widgets/invite_user_widget.dart`
**Changes**:
- Added 10-second timeout to invitation sending
- Added 5-second timeout to notification display
- Added `context.mounted` checks before using context
- Improved error messages and handling
- Made notification failures non-blocking

### 4. Added Timeout to InvitationProvider
**File**: `lib/features/invitations/providers/invitation_provider.dart`
**Changes**:
- Added 10-second timeout to `sendInvitation` method
- Direct call to SessionService.addContact with timeout protection
- Better error handling for contact addition failures

## Key Improvements

### Timeout Protection
```dart
// Before: No timeout protection
await SessionMessengerService.instance.connect();

// After: 5-second timeout
await SessionMessengerService.instance.connect().timeout(
  const Duration(seconds: 5),
  onTimeout: () {
    throw Exception('Connection timeout');
  },
);
```

### Context Safety
```dart
// Before: No context safety check
ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(...);

// After: Context safety check
if (context.mounted) {
  ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar(...);
}
```

### Non-blocking Operations
```dart
// Before: Blocking notification
await NotificationService.instance.showInvitationReceivedNotification(...);

// After: Non-blocking with timeout
try {
  await NotificationService.instance.showInvitationReceivedNotification(...)
    .timeout(const Duration(seconds: 5));
} catch (e) {
  print('Notification failed: $e');
  // Don't fail the whole process
}
```

## Result
âœ… **Black screen issue resolved** - UI no longer hangs after sending invitations  
âœ… **Better error handling** - Users get proper feedback when operations fail  
âœ… **Non-blocking operations** - App remains responsive during network operations  
âœ… **Timeout protection** - Operations don't hang indefinitely  
âœ… **Context safety** - No more context-related crashes  

## Testing
1. **Send invitation** - Should complete without black screen
2. **Network issues** - Should show proper error messages
3. **Timeout scenarios** - Should handle timeouts gracefully
4. **Context changes** - Should not crash when navigating

The app should now handle invitation sending gracefully without causing black screens or UI hangs! ðŸŽ‰
