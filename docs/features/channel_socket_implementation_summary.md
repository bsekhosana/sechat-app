# Channel-Based Socket Implementation Summary

## üéØ **What We've Implemented**

### 1. **New ChannelSocketService** ‚úÖ
- **File**: `lib/core/services/channel_socket_service.dart`
- **Purpose**: Replaces the old global event broadcasting system
- **Key Feature**: Targeted channel communication with dynamic event naming
- **Encryption**: Integrates with existing local encryption services

### 2. **Updated Register Screen** ‚úÖ
- **File**: `lib/features/auth/screens/register_screen.dart`
- **Change**: Now uses `ChannelSocketService` instead of `SeSocketService`
- **Result**: Users automatically join their session channel upon registration

### 3. **Server Implementation Guide** ‚úÖ
- **File**: `docs/features/channel_socket_server_implementation.md`
- **Purpose**: Complete server-side implementation for the new system
- **Includes**: Socket.IO setup, event handlers, and testing examples
- **Security**: Server cannot read encrypted payloads

## üîê **Encryption Architecture**

### **Key Exchange Events (KER) - Two Phase Process**
- **Phase 1 (Unencrypted)**: Public key sharing for establishing encrypted communication
  - `key_exchange:session_123:request` - Initial public key exchange
  - `key_exchange:session_123:response` - Response with recipient's public key
- **Phase 2 (Encrypted)**: User data exchange after both parties have keys
  - `user_data_exchange:session_123:data` - Encrypted display name exchange
  - `conversation_created:session_123:data` - Conversation creation confirmation

### **All Other Events - Encrypted**
- **Purpose**: User data, messages, typing indicators, presence updates
- **Events**: `typing:session_123:start`, `chat:session_123:new_message`
- **Encryption**: Uses `EncryptionService.encryptAesCbcPkcs7()`
- **Server Access**: Server cannot read encrypted content, only routes events

### **Complete KER Flow**
1. **Phase 1 - Public Key Exchange (Unencrypted)**
   - Initial sender sends public key via `key_exchange:request`
   - Recipient accepts and sends public key via `key_exchange:response`
2. **Phase 2 - User Data Exchange (Encrypted)**
   - Initial sender sends encrypted display name via `user_data_exchange`
   - Recipient creates conversation and sends confirmation via `conversation_created`
   - Recipient sends encrypted display name back via `user_data_exchange`
   - Initial sender creates conversation and sends confirmation via `conversation_created`

### **Encryption Flow**
1. **Client encrypts payload** using local encryption service
2. **Encrypted data sent** to server with routing information
3. **Server routes event** to recipient without reading content
4. **Recipient decrypts** using stored keys from KER handshake

## üöÄ **Key Features Implemented**

### **Event Naming Convention**
```
action:sessionId:actionType
```

**Examples**:
- `typing:session_123:start` - User 123 started typing (encrypted)
- `typing:session_123:stop` - User 123 stopped typing (encrypted)
- `chat:session_123:new_message` - New message from user 123 (encrypted)
- `presence:session_123:online` - User 123 came online (encrypted)
- `key_exchange:session_123:request` - Key exchange request from user 123 (unencrypted)
- `key_exchange:session_123:response` - Key exchange response from user 123 (unencrypted)
- `user_data_exchange:session_123:data` - User data exchange from user 123 (encrypted)
- `conversation_created:session_123:data` - Conversation created confirmation from user 123 (encrypted)

### **Simplified Payload Structure**
```javascript
// Encrypted Events
{
  conversation_id: "session_456",        // Always equals recipient's session ID
  encrypted_data: "base64_encrypted_payload",  // Server cannot read this
  checksum: "sha256_checksum",           // Integrity verification
  timestamp: "2025-08-20T10:24:29.196Z"
}

// Unencrypted KER Events (Phase 1)
{
  conversation_id: "session_456",        // Always equals recipient's session ID
  sender_id: "session_123",             // Sender's session ID
  publicKey: "base64_public_key",       // Public key for encryption
  requestId: "uuid_request_id",         // Request identifier
  requestPhrase: "Secret phrase",       // Request phrase
  version: 1,                           // Key version
  timestamp: "2025-08-20T10:24:29.196Z"
}

// Encrypted KER Events (Phase 2)
{
  conversation_id: "session_456",        // Always equals recipient's session ID
  encrypted_data: "base64_encrypted_payload",  // Contains display name, conversation data
  checksum: "sha256_checksum",           // Integrity verification
  timestamp: "2025-08-20T10:24:29.196Z"
}
```

### **Channel-Based Communication**
- **No more global broadcasting** - Events only sent to relevant recipients
- **Automatic channel joining** - Users join their session channel upon connection
- **Dynamic event listeners** - Set up listeners for specific contacts only
- **Server-side routing** - No client-side filtering required
- **End-to-end encryption** - All user data remains private

## üîß **Technical Implementation Details**

### **Client-Side (Flutter)**
1. **ChannelSocketService** - Main service for channel-based communication
2. **Encryption Integration** - Uses existing `EncryptionService` for payload encryption
3. **Dynamic Event Listeners** - Automatically set up listeners for contacts
4. **Automatic Channel Joining** - Users join their session channel on connection
5. **Targeted Event Sending** - Events only sent to specific recipients

### **Server-Side (Node.js + Socket.IO)**
1. **Room Management** - Users join `session_${sessionId}` rooms
2. **Event Routing** - Server routes events to specific channels only
3. **Session Tracking** - Maps session IDs to socket IDs for efficient routing
4. **Privacy Protection** - Server cannot read encrypted payloads
5. **KER Handling** - Server can read unencrypted key exchange data

## ‚úÖ **Benefits Achieved**
