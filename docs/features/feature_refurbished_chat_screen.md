# Refurbished Chat Message Screen

## Objective
Replace the current chat message screen with a unified, modern chat screen that encapsulates all existing features while improving flaws like proper message tracking, real-time responsiveness, and WhatsApp-like user experience.

## Context
The current chat screen (`lib/features/chat/screens/chat_screen.dart`) has several issues:
- Complex message tracking and status updates
- Inconsistent real-time updates
- Performance issues with large conversations
- Non-WhatsApp-like UI/UX
- Poor responsive behavior
- Socket event handling inconsistencies

## Clarifying Q&A

### Core Functionality & Scope
**Q: Should I first analyze the existing chat message screen to understand what features need to be preserved and what flaws need to be fixed?**
A: Yes, analysis completed. Current screen has complex provider logic, inconsistent message tracking, and performance issues.

**Q: What types of messages should the new screen support?**
A: Text only for now, with extensibility for future message types.

**Q: What specific message tracking issues exist currently?**
A: Typing indicators, live message sending, message status updates, presence updates, delivery receipts, read receipts.

**Q: Which specific WhatsApp features should be mimicked?**
A: Message bubbles, timestamps, status indicators (single/double ticks), reply functionality, proper message ordering.

### Technical Requirements
**Q: What specific socket events need to be handled for real-time updates?**
A: `msgReceived`, `msgAcked`, `rcptDelivered`, `rcptRead`, `typingStatusUpdate`, `presenceUpdate`, `userDeparted`.

**Q: Are there specific performance requirements?**
A: Sleek, fast, UI responsive without reloading screen, lazy loading for large conversations.

**Q: Should this work on both iOS and Android with the same functionality?**
A: Yes, cross-platform compatibility required.

### UI/UX Requirements
**Q: Should I follow any existing design system?**
A: Yes, follow the chat list screen design system for consistency.

**Q: What specific responsive behaviors are needed?**
A: Keyboard handling, screen rotation, different screen sizes, proper scrolling behavior.

**Q: Are there specific accessibility requirements?**
A: No specific requirements mentioned.

### Integration & Migration
**Q: How should existing chat data be handled during the transition?**
A: Complete migration, no backwards compatibility required.

**Q: Do we need to maintain compatibility with the old chat screen during development?**
A: No, complete replacement.

**Q: Should I include unit tests, integration tests, or both?**
A: None required for this implementation.

### Edge Cases
**Q: How should the chat screen behave when offline?**
A: Show disconnected status, disable send button, utilize existing connection status widget.

**Q: How should it handle conversations with thousands of messages?**
A: Load latest messages first, then lazy load older messages when scrolling up. WhatsApp-style message ordering.

**Q: What error scenarios should be gracefully handled?**
A: Socket connection errors, message send failures, network disconnections.

## Notes & Open Questions

### Technical Considerations
- Need to maintain compatibility with existing `SessionChatProvider` initially
- Socket event handling should follow existing patterns in `realtime_gateway.dart`
- Message encryption/decryption must follow existing `encryption_service` patterns
- Connection status should integrate with existing `ConnectionStatusWidget`

### Design Decisions
- Message ordering: Latest messages at bottom (WhatsApp style)
- Status indicators: Single tick (sent), double tick (delivered), blue double tick (read)
- Typing indicator: Smooth animation with user name
- Input area: Rounded design with proper keyboard handling
- Message bubbles: Rounded corners, proper spacing, WhatsApp-like styling

### Performance Considerations
- Implement message virtualization for conversations with 1000+ messages
- Lazy load older messages when scrolling up
- Optimize real-time updates to prevent unnecessary rebuilds
- Use proper state management to minimize memory usage

### Integration Points
- `lib/features/chat/screens/chat_screen.dart` - Current implementation to replace
- `lib/features/chat/providers/session_chat_provider.dart` - State management
- `lib/core/realtime/realtime_gateway.dart` - Socket event handling
- `lib/shared/widgets/connection_status_widget.dart` - Connection status
- `lib/features/chat/widgets/message_bubble.dart` - Message display components

### Future Enhancements
