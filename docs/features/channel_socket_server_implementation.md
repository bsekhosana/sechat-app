# Channel-Based Socket Server Implementation

## Overview

This document provides the server-side implementation overview for the new channel-based socket system that replaces the old global event broadcasting approach.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Encryption Architecture**
- **KER Events (Unencrypted)**: Only key exchange request/response events are unencrypted for public key sharing
- **All Other Events (Encrypted)**: Typing indicators, messages, presence updates, etc. contain encrypted payloads
- **Server Cannot Read Encrypted Data**: The server only sees the event name and routing information, not the actual content
- **Client-Side Encryption**: All encryption/decryption happens locally using the user's stored keys

## Architecture Overview

### Event Naming Convention

### Format: `action:sessionId:actionType`

- **typing:session_123:start** - User 123 started typing (encrypted)
- **typing:session_123:stop** - User 123 stopped typing (encrypted)
- **chat:session_123:new_message** - New message from user 123 (encrypted)
- **presence:session_123:online** - User 123 came online (encrypted)
- **presence:session_123:offline** - User 123 went offline (encrypted)
- **key_exchange:session_123:request** - Key exchange request from user 123 (unencrypted)
- **key_exchange:session_123:response** - Key exchange response from user 123 (unencrypted)
- **user_data_exchange:session_123:data** - User data exchange from user 123 (encrypted)
- **conversation_created:session_123:data** - Conversation created confirmation from user 123 (encrypted)

### Complete KER Flow

The Key Exchange Request (KER) process involves **two handshake phases**:

#### Phase 1: Public Key Exchange (Unencrypted)
1. **key_exchange:request** - Initial sender sends public key to recipient
2. **key_exchange:response** - Recipient accepts and sends their public key back

#### Phase 2: User Data Exchange (Encrypted)
3. **user_data_exchange** - Initial sender sends encrypted display name to recipient
4. **conversation_created** - Recipient creates conversation and sends confirmation
5. **user_data_exchange** - Recipient sends encrypted display name back to initial sender
6. **conversation_created** - Initial sender creates conversation and sends confirmation

**Why Phase 2 is Encrypted:**
- Both parties now have each other's public keys
- Can establish encrypted communication
- User data (display names) is sensitive information
- Enables secure conversation creation

### Payload Structure

### Encrypted Events (Typing, Messages, Presence, User Data Exchange)
```javascript
{
  conversation_id: "session_456",        // Always equals recipient's session ID
  encrypted_data: "base64_encrypted_payload",  // Server cannot read this
  checksum: "sha256_checksum",           // Integrity verification
  timestamp: "2025-08-20T10:24:29.196Z"
}
```

### Unencrypted Events (Key Exchange - KER Phase 1)
```javascript
{
  conversation_id: "session_456",        // Always equals recipient's session ID
  sender_id: "session_123",             // Sender's session ID
  publicKey: "base64_public_key",       // Public key for encryption
  requestId: "uuid_request_id",         // Request identifier
  requestPhrase: "Secret phrase",       // Request phrase
  version: 1,                           // Key version
  timestamp: "2025-08-20T10:24:29.196Z"
}
```

## Security Architecture

### 1. **Encrypted Communication**
- **All user data is encrypted** before being sent to the server
- **Server cannot read** message content, typing status, or presence details
- **Only routing information** (conversation_id) is visible to the server

### 2. **Unencrypted KER Events**
- **Key exchange events are unencrypted** to allow public key sharing
- **Public keys are meant to be shared** and are not sensitive
- **Enables end-to-end encryption** for all subsequent communication

### 3. **Server Role**
- **Acts as a secure router** - cannot access encrypted content
- **Manages user sessions** and channel membership
- **Provides targeted delivery** without compromising privacy

## Key Benefits

1. **End-to-End Encryption** - All user data remains encrypted
2. **Server Privacy** - Server cannot read message content or user status
3. **Targeted Delivery** - Events only sent to relevant recipients
4. **No Client-Side Filtering** - Server handles all routing
5. **Better Performance** - Reduced network traffic and processing
6. **Enhanced Security** - Server-side access control without data access

## Monitoring Interface

The server includes a comprehensive real-time monitoring interface:

- **Real-time channel list** with event counts
- **Live event viewing** for selected channels
- **Connection statistics** (connections, channels, events)
- **Event details** including encryption status
- **Auto-refresh** every 5 seconds

### Features

- **Sidebar**: List of all active channels with event badges
- **Main Content**: Live events for selected channel
- **Stats Bar**: Real-time connection and event statistics
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile

## Getting Started

### 1. **Install Dependencies**
```bash
cd ../sechat_socket
npm install
```

### 2. **Start Server**
```bash
# Development mode
npm run dev

# Production mode
npm start
```

### 3. **Access Monitoring Interface**
```
http://localhost:3000
```

## Testing

### Test Encrypted Events (Server cannot read content)
```bash
# Test typing indicator (encrypted)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/test/typing \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"conversation_id": "session_456", "encrypted_data": "base64_encrypted_data", "checksum": "sha256_checksum"}'

# Test message (encrypted)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/test/message \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"conversation_id": "session_456", "encrypted_data": "base64_encrypted_data", "checksum": "sha256_checksum"}'
```

### Test Unencrypted KER Events (Server can read content)
```bash
# Test key exchange request (unencrypted)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/test/key_exchange \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"conversation_id": "session_456", "sender_id": "session_123", "publicKey": "base64_public_key", "requestId": "uuid"}'
```

## Next Steps

The server implementation is complete and ready for deployment. The next steps are:

1. **Deploy the server** to your production environment
2. **Update client applications** to use the new ChannelSocketService
3. **Test the complete system** with real users
4. **Monitor performance** using the built-in monitoring interface

This server implementation provides a robust foundation for the channel-based socket system while maintaining complete privacy through end-to-end encryption. The server acts as a secure router without access to sensitive user data.
