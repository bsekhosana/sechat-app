# Feature: WhatsApp-like Chat Implementation with End-to-End Encryption

## 🎯 Objective
Implement a comprehensive, modern chat system similar to WhatsApp with end-to-end encryption for all message types (text, voice, video, images, documents, location, contacts), real-time message status updates, typing indicators, and intelligent notification handling.

## 📋 Context
The app will transition to sending only encrypted data. This chat system will provide a secure, feature-rich messaging experience with modern UX patterns, real-time updates, and comprehensive media support while maintaining user privacy through encryption.

## ❓ Clarifying Q&A

### Core Functionality
- **Message Types**: Text, voice recording (2min max), short video clips (1min max), emoticons, images, documents, location sharing, contact sharing, reply/quote functionality ✅
- **Voice Recording**: 2-minute max, playback controls (pause, seek, speed), no auto-play ✅
- **Video Clips**: 1-minute max, compression with "do not compress" option, user interaction required ✅

### Technical Requirements
- **Size Restrictions**: Minimal reasonable limits to avoid encryption strain, automatic compression, progress indicators ✅
- **Encryption**: AES-256-CBC for all message types, same encryption method, message integrity verification ✅
- **Notifications**: Generic notifications (e.g., "Video Received"), app icon badges, customizable per conversation ✅

### User Experience
- **Chat Features**: Message search, deletion (both parties option), forwarding, 1-on-1 conversations only ✅
- **Typing Indicators**: Show on chat list items, replace latest message label, work across multiple conversations ✅
- **Message Status**: Real-time updates, last seen (editable in settings), read receipts for all message types ✅

### Advanced Features
- **Performance & Storage**: Local encrypted storage, storage usage alerts (100MB-10GB), manual cleanup in settings ✅
- **Accessibility**: Voice message transcription if free ✅
- **Offline Handling**: Message queuing, retry mechanisms for failed deliveries ✅
- **Media Handling**: Permission requests with guidance, fallback options, media preview before sending ✅

## 🔄 Reusability Notes
- Leverage existing `EncryptionService` for message encryption
- Use existing `SimpleNotificationService` for notification handling
- Extend current `KeyExchangeRequestProvider` for secure connections
- Reuse existing UI components and providers where applicable
- Implement message status system similar to existing KER status updates
