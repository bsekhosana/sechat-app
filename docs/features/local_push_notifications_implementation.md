# LocalPushNotifications Implementation - Complete Replacement

## Objective
Remove all current socket-based push notification systems and implement a new LocalPushNotifications feature that acts like LocalNotificationItem but without database dependencies, specifically catering for socket-based local push notifications.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Notification Systems to Remove
1. **SocketNotificationService** - Core service for socket event notifications
2. **NotificationManagerService** - Manages socket notifications with database
3. **NotificationDatabaseService** - Database storage for notifications
4. **SocketNotification** model - Complex notification model with database fields
5. **LocalNotificationBadgeService** - Badge counting service
6. **LocalNotificationItemsService** - Items management service
7. **flutter_local_notifications** dependency - External push notification library

### Files to Remove/Modify
- `lib/core/services/socket_notification_service.dart`
- `lib/features/notifications/services/notification_manager_service.dart`
- `lib/features/notifications/services/notification_database_service.dart`
- `lib/features/notifications/models/socket_notification.dart`
- `lib/features/notifications/services/local_notification_badge_service.dart`
- `lib/features/notifications/services/local_notification_items_service.dart`
- `lib/features/notifications/screens/socket_notifications_screen.dart`
- `lib/features/notifications/widgets/notification_action_screen.dart`
- `lib/features/notifications/models/notification_icons.dart`
- `lib/features/notifications/models/notification_types.dart`

### Dependencies to Remove
- `flutter_local_notifications: ^18.0.0` from pubspec.yaml

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Remove Current Notification Systems
- [ ] Remove all notification service files
- [ ] Remove notification models and screens
- [ ] Remove flutter_local_notifications dependency
- [ ] Clean up main.dart notification initialization
- [ ] Remove notification-related imports throughout codebase

### Phase 2: Create New LocalPushNotifications System
- [ ] Create LocalPushNotifications service (no database)
- [ ] Implement socket event handling for local notifications
- [ ] Create simple notification models for socket events
- [ ] Integrate with existing socket services
- [ ] Test basic functionality

### Phase 3: Integration and Testing
- [ ] Integrate with main.dart
- [ ] Test with socket events
- [ ] Verify no database dependencies
- [ ] Clean up any remaining notification code

## Progress Tracking

### Phase 1: Removal âœ…
- [x] Identified all files to remove
- [x] Created implementation plan
- [ ] Remove notification services
- [ ] Remove notification models
- [ ] Remove notification screens
- [ ] Remove flutter_local_notifications dependency
- [ ] Clean up main.dart

### Phase 2: New Implementation
- [ ] Create LocalPushNotifications service
- [ ] Implement socket event handlers
- [ ] Create notification models

### Phase 3: Integration
- [ ] Integrate with main.dart
- [ ] Test functionality
- [ ] Final cleanup

## Notes
- New system should be lightweight and focused only on socket-based local notifications
- No database dependencies - everything should be in-memory
- Should integrate seamlessly with existing socket services
- Focus on simplicity and reliability
