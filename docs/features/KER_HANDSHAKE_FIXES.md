# 🔑 Key Exchange Request (KER) Handshake Fixes

## 🚨 **Critical Issues Identified & Fixed**

### **1. API Compliance Issues**
- **Problem**: Code was not following the documented API specification
- **Solution**: Updated to use correct `key_exchange:decline` event instead of `key_exchange:response`

### **2. Payload Structure Mismatch**
- **Problem**: Missing required fields and incorrect field mapping
- **Solution**: Fixed payload to match API documentation exactly:
  ```dart
  _socketService.emit('key_exchange:decline', {
    'recipientId': _socketService.currentSessionId, // The decliner (us)
    'senderId': request.fromSessionId, // The requester (who sent the request)
    'requestId': request.id, // Use original requestId
    'reason': 'User declined the key exchange request', // Optional reason
    'timestamp': DateTime.now().toIso8601String(),
    'version': requestVersion,
  });
  ```

### **3. Event Routing Confusion**
- **Problem**: Using both ChannelSocketService and SeSocketService inconsistently
- **Solution**: Standardized on SeSocketService for decline events to ensure proper delivery

### **4. Missing Event Listener**
- **Problem**: No listener for `key_exchange:declined` events
- **Solution**: Added proper event listener in SeSocketService:
  ```dart
  _socket!.on('key_exchange:declined', (data) async {
    // Handle decline events and convert to response format for compatibility
  });
  ```

### **5. Response Processing Inconsistency**
- **Problem**: Decline responses not properly handled in main event listener
- **Solution**: Enhanced main.dart to handle both accept and decline cases with proper reason display

### **6. Accept KER API Compliance**
- **Problem**: Accept KER payload missing required fields according to API spec
- **Solution**: Enhanced accept payload to include all required fields:
  ```dart
  _socketService.emit('key_exchange:accept', {
    'requestId': request.id,
    'recipientId': currentUserId, // The acceptor (us)
    'senderId': request.fromSessionId, // The requester
    'version': request.version ?? '1', // Include version for consistency
    'timestamp': DateTime.now().toIso8601String(), // Include timestamp for tracking
    'reason': 'Key exchange request accepted', // Optional reason for user experience
  });
  ```

### **7. Missing Accept Event Listener**
- **Problem**: No listener for `key_exchange:accepted` events
- **Solution**: Added proper event listener in SeSocketService for consistency:
  ```dart
  _socket!.on('key_exchange:accepted', (data) async {
    // Handle accept events and convert to response format for compatibility
  });
  ```

### **8. Critical Field Mapping Bug**
- **Problem**: Decline KER was being sent to the wrong recipient due to incorrect field mapping
- **Solution**: Fixed field mapping to match API specification exactly:
  - `recipientId` = The decliner (us, when we decline someone's request)
  - `senderId` = The requester (the person who sent the request)

### **9. UI Update Failure**
- **Problem**: RangeError when processing decline responses due to empty senderId
- **Solution**: Fixed string substring operations and improved error handling

## 📋 **API Compliance Checklist**

### **key_exchange:decline Event**
- ✅ `recipientId`: The decliner (who is declining)
- ✅ `senderId`: The requester (who sent the request)
- ✅ `requestId`: Original request ID
- ✅ `reason`: Optional reason for declining
- ✅ `timestamp`: ISO timestamp
- ✅ `version`: Protocol version

**Important**: The field mapping follows the API specification exactly:
- `recipientId` = The person declining (us, when we decline someone's request)
- `senderId` = The person who sent the original request (the person we're declining)

**Note**: The actual event structure received from the server may differ from the API documentation. Based on logs, the `key_exchange:declined` event contains:
```json
{
  "senderId": "session_xxx", // The decliner (who declined)
  "response": "declined",
  "requestId": "xxx",
  "reason": "User declined the key exchange request",
  "timestamp": "2025-08-27T20:40:27.804Z"
}
```

The `recipientId` field is missing from the actual event, so we use `senderId` as the decliner's ID.

### **key_exchange:accept Event**
- ✅ `requestId`: Request ID to accept
- ✅ `recipientId`: Acceptor's user ID (you)
- ✅ `senderId`: Requester's user ID
- ✅ `version`: Protocol version (added)
- ✅ `timestamp`: ISO timestamp (added)
- ✅ `reason`: Optional reason for accepting (added)

**Important**: The field mapping follows the API specification exactly:
- `recipientId` = The person accepting (us, when we accept someone's request)
- `senderId` = The person who sent the original request (the person we're accepting)

### **Event Flow**
1. **User A** sends `key_exchange:request` to **User B** (with User A's public key)
2. **User B** receives request and calls `key_exchange:accept` or `key_exchange:decline`
3. **Server** automatically sends `key_exchange:response` (for accept) or `key_exchange:declined` (for decline)
4. **Both users** now have each other's public keys (for accept) or clear status (for decline)
5. **Users can exchange encrypted data** using `user_data_exchange:send` (for accept)
6. **Conversation is created** using `conversation:created` (for accept)

## 🧪 **Testing Scenarios**

### **Scenario 1: Basic Accept Flow**
1. User A sends KER to User B
2. User B accepts the request with proper payload
3. Server automatically sends `key_exchange:response` to User A
4. User A receives response with User B's public key
5. Both users now have each other's public keys

### **Scenario 2: Basic Decline Flow**
1. User A sends KER to User B
2. User B declines the request with proper payload
3. User A receives `key_exchange:declined` event
4. User A's UI updates to show declined status
5. User A receives notification with decline reason

### **Scenario 3: Offline User Handling**
1. User A sends KER to User B (offline)
2. User B comes online and accepts/declines the request
3. Server delivers queued response/decline event
4. User A receives notification
5. Both users' states are synchronized

### **Scenario 4: Accept/Decline Retry**
1. User B tries to accept/decline but socket is disconnected
2. Action is queued for retry
3. When socket reconnects, action is automatically retried
4. User A receives the appropriate notification
