# iOS Memory Warning Fix and Memory Management Improvements

## üö® Problem Description

The SeChat iOS app was crashing with the following error when receiving memory warnings:

```
-[Runner.AppDelegate applicationDidReceiveMemoryWarning:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance
*** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException'
```

This occurred because iOS was trying to call the `applicationDidReceiveMemoryWarning:` method on the AppDelegate, but the method was not being properly recognized due to a build cache issue.

## ‚úÖ Solution Implemented

### **1. Fixed AppDelegate Method Recognition**

**File**: `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift`

The `applicationDidReceiveMemoryWarning` method was already present but not being recognized due to build cache issues. The solution involved:

- **Build Cache Cleanup**: Ran `flutter clean` and `xcodebuild clean` to resolve linking issues
- **Method Verification**: Confirmed the method signature was correct
- **Project Rebuild**: Successfully rebuilt the iOS project

### **2. Enhanced Memory Warning Handler**

**File**: `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift`

```swift
override func applicationDidReceiveMemoryWarning(_ application: UIApplication) {
  print("üì± iOS: Application did receive memory warning")
  
  // Log current memory usage
  let memoryUsage = ProcessInfo.processInfo.physicalMemory
  let memoryUsageMB = Double(memoryUsage) / 1024.0 / 1024.0
  print("üì± iOS: Current memory usage: \(String(format: "%.2f", memoryUsageMB)) MB")
  
  // Clear image caches to free memory
  URLCache.shared.removeAllCachedResponses()
  print("üì± iOS: Cleared URL cache")
  
  // Clear any NSCache instances if they exist
  NotificationCenter.default.post(name: NSNotification.Name("ClearMemoryCaches"), object: nil)
  print("üì± iOS: Posted memory cache clear notification")
  
  // Force garbage collection if possible
  autoreleasepool {
    // This will help release autoreleased objects
  }
  
  super.applicationDidReceiveMemoryWarning(application)
}
```

**Key Features**:
- ‚úÖ **Memory Usage Logging**: Tracks current memory consumption
- ‚úÖ **Cache Clearing**: Automatically clears URL caches
- ‚úÖ **Notification Broadcasting**: Alerts other components to clear caches
- ‚úÖ **Autorelease Pool**: Forces cleanup of autoreleased objects

### **3. Proactive Memory Management Service**

**File**: `lib/core/services/memory_management_service.dart`

Created a new Flutter service to proactively manage memory usage:

```dart
class MemoryManagementService {
  // Periodic memory monitoring every 30 seconds
  void _startMemoryMonitoring() {
    _memoryCheckTimer = Timer.periodic(const Duration(seconds: 30), (timer) {
      _checkMemoryUsage();
    });
  }
  
  // Proactive memory optimization when usage is high
  Future<void> _optimizeMemory() async {
    await _clearImageCaches();
    await _clearTempFiles();
  }
}
```

**Key Features**:
- ‚úÖ **Proactive Monitoring**: Checks memory usage every 30 seconds
- ‚úÖ **Threshold-Based Optimization**: Automatically optimizes when usage exceeds 500MB
- ‚úÖ **Cache Management**: Clears image caches and temporary files
- ‚úÖ **iOS Integration**: Responds to iOS memory warning notifications

### **4. Integration with Main App**

**File**: `lib/main.dart`

The memory management service is now initialized alongside other core services:

```dart
await Future.wait([
  LocalStorageService.instance.initialize(),
  SeSharedPreferenceService().initialize(),
  MessageStorageService.instance.initialize(),
  MemoryManagementService.instance.initialize(), // NEW
]);
```

## üîß Technical Details

### **Build Cache Issue Resolution**

The original problem was caused by:
1. **Stale Build Cache**: Xcode and Flutter build caches contained outdated linking information
2. **Method Recognition Failure**: The `applicationDidReceiveMemoryWarning` method existed but wasn't properly linked
3. **Runtime Exception**: iOS couldn't find the method when sending memory warnings

**Resolution Steps**:
```bash
# Clean Flutter build cache
flutter clean

# Clean Xcode build cache
cd ios && xcodebuild clean -workspace Runner.xcworkspace -scheme Runner

# Reinstall pods
pod install

# Rebuild project
flutter build ios --debug --no-codesign
```

## üì± iOS-Specific Optimizations

### **1. URL Cache Management**
- Automatically clears `URLCache.shared` when memory warnings occur
- Prevents image and network response caching from consuming excessive memory

### **2. Autorelease Pool Management**
- Uses `autoreleasepool` blocks to force cleanup of autoreleased objects
- Helps iOS reclaim memory more efficiently

### **3. Notification Broadcasting**
- Posts `ClearMemoryCaches` notifications to coordinate cleanup across the app
- Allows other components to respond to memory pressure

## üéØ Prevention Strategies

### **1. Proactive Monitoring**
- **30-Second Intervals**: Regular memory usage checks
- **500MB Threshold**: Automatic optimization when usage is high
- **Real-time Logging**: Continuous memory usage tracking

### **2. Cache Management**
- **Image Caches**: Automatic clearing of image caches
- **Temporary Files**: Regular cleanup of temporary storage
- **URL Caches**: Clearing of network response caches

### **3. Memory Optimization**
- **Background Cleanup**: Automatic memory optimization in background
- **Threshold-Based Actions**: Smart responses to memory pressure
- **Coordinated Cleanup**: System-wide memory management coordination

## üß™ Testing Recommendations

### **1. Memory Warning Testing**
- Use Xcode Instruments to simulate memory warnings
- Monitor app behavior during low memory conditions
- Verify crash prevention and recovery

### **2. Memory Usage Monitoring**
- Test with large image files and media content
- Monitor memory usage during extended app usage
- Verify automatic optimization triggers

### **3. Cache Clearing Verification**
- Confirm image caches are properly cleared
- Verify temporary file cleanup
- Test notification broadcasting to other components

## üìà Performance Impact

### **Before Fix**
- ‚ùå **App Crashes**: Unhandled memory warnings caused app termination
- ‚ùå **Memory Leaks**: No proactive memory management
- ‚ùå **Poor User Experience**: Unexpected app crashes

### **After Fix**
- ‚úÖ **Stable Operation**: Memory warnings are properly handled
- ‚úÖ **Proactive Management**: Automatic memory optimization
- ‚úÖ **Better Performance**: Reduced memory pressure and crashes
- ‚úÖ **User Experience**: Reliable app operation under memory pressure

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

### **1. Advanced Memory Analytics**
