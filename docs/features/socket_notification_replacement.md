# Socket Notification Replacement Feature

## Objective
Replace all push notification infrastructure with SeChat socket-based real-time communication, removing legacy code and implementing a clean, encrypted socket solution.

## Context
- Current app uses extensive push notification services (Firebase, AirNotifier, local notifications)
- SeChat socket server is fully implemented and running at https://sechat-socket.strapblaque.com/
- Socket server handles session management, message queuing, and offline notifications
- Flutter app will manage encryption/decryption and socket sessions

## Clarifying Q&A
1. **Scope**: Replace ALL push notifications (Firebase, AirNotifier, local) with socket events
2. **Session Management**: Maintain persistent sessions across app restarts, only terminate on user session deletion
3. **Offline Handling**: Send directly to server for queuing if recipient offline, local queuing if sender offline
4. **Encryption**: App handles encryption/decryption via se_session, encryption_service, and key_exchange_service
5. **Event Types**: All existing app functionality + socket server capabilities
6. **Legacy Code**: Remove push notification handling but keep app functionality identical
7. **Testing**: No unit tests needed
8. **Migration**: Complete replacement - no gradual migration

## Reusability Notes
- Socket service will be reusable across all real-time features
- Encryption service already exists and can be extended
- Session management can be reused for other socket-based features

## Planned Steps
- [x] Analyze current notification infrastructure
- [x] Create SeChat socket service for Flutter
- [x] Implement session management and connection handling
- [x] Create socket event handlers for all notification types
- [x] Implement local message queuing for offline scenarios
- [x] Remove all push notification services and dependencies
- [x] Update main.dart to use socket instead of notifications
- [x] Remove notification providers and related UI components
- [x] Update chat features to use socket events
- [x] Implement reconnection logic and offline handling
- [x] Add unit tests for socket integration (skipped per user request)
- [x] Clean up legacy code and unused dependencies
- [ ] Test end-to-end socket communication

## Notes & Open Questions
- Need to verify socket server event types and payload formats
- Determine optimal reconnection strategy for mobile networks
- Plan for graceful degradation when socket is unavailable
