# Feature: End-to-End Encryption with WhatsApp Style Chat Messaging

## Objective
Implement full end-to-end encryption for all messages and notifications, ensuring only intended recipients can decrypt the data. Add WhatsApp-style chat features including typing indicators, online status, and the 3-way message handshake system.

## Context
The current application has basic encryption for some messages but lacks a comprehensive end-to-end encryption system. The existing notification system sends some unencrypted data. The messaging experience needs enhancement with WhatsApp-style features like typing indicators, online status display, and delivery/read receipts.

The encryption should cover all communications, including:
- Chat messages
- Invitation requests
- Invitation responses
- Typing indicators
- Status updates

All notifications are handled through Airnotifier, which is integrated into the project.

## Clarifying Q&A
- **Q: Should we use the existing encryption service or build a new one?**  
  A: Enhance the existing encryption service, extending it to handle all communication types.

- **Q: What encryption algorithm should we use?**  
  A: Continue using AES-256-CBC for symmetric encryption with proper key exchange.

- **Q: How should the 3-way message handshake work with offline users?**  
  A: Messages will be stored locally with 'sent' status (step 1). When the recipient's device receives the message, it will send a silent notification to update status to 'delivered' (step 2). When the recipient opens the chat, another silent notification will update status to 'read' (step 3).

- **Q: How will typing indicators be sent and managed?**  
  A: Using silent encrypted notifications, with a cooldown mechanism to prevent notification flooding.

## Reusability Notes
- The encryption service will be enhanced to be more generic and support all message types
- The chat components will be refactored to support the 3-way handshake system
- All notification handling will be modified to ensure proper encryption/decryption
- AirNotifier service will be updated to support encrypted payloads for all communication types

## Planned Steps
- [x] Enhance encryption service to handle all types of data
- [x] Implement key exchange mechanism for secure communication
- [x] Update message model to support new status types and handshake
- [x] Update notification service to encrypt all outgoing notifications
- [x] Implement secure message sending with handshake step 1
- [x] Implement silent notification for handshake step 2 (delivered)
- [x] Implement silent notification for handshake step 3 (read)
- [x] Add typing indicator detection and notification
- [x] Implement typing indicator UI in chat screen
- [x] Add online status detection and display in chat list
- [x] Update ChatScreen to show message status indicators (1 tick, 2 ticks, 2 blue ticks)
- [x] Update message processing to handle encrypted notifications
- [x] Add batch read receipt for multiple messages
- [x] Remove/replace any non-encrypted notifications
- [x] Add comprehensive error handling for encryption failures

## Current Status
Implementation completed. 

Completed core encryption functionality and message handshake system:
- Enhanced encryption service for handling all types of data
- Implemented secure key exchange mechanism
- Updated message model to support the 3-way handshake system
- Implemented all 3 steps of the message delivery handshake
- Added encryption for all outgoing notifications
- Updated UI to show WhatsApp-style message indicators (1 tick, 2 ticks, 2 blue ticks)
- Added batch read receipts for multiple messages
- Implemented typing indicator detection and notification
- Added animated typing indicator UI to chat screen (WhatsApp style)
- Implemented online status detection and display in chat list
- Replaced all non-encrypted notifications with encrypted versions
- Added comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages, retry mechanisms, and key recovery

All planned tasks have been completed.

## Version History
- v0.1 (2023-10-07) - Initial feature specification
- v0.2 (2023-10-07) - Core encryption implementation and 3-way handshake system
- v0.3 (2023-10-07) - Typing indicator and UI enhancements
- v0.4 (2023-10-07) - Online status detection and display
- v0.5 (2023-10-07) - Replaced all non-encrypted notifications with encrypted versions
- v0.6 (2023-10-07) - Added comprehensive error handling and key recovery mechanisms

## Notes & Open Questions
- Need to determine how to handle the case when encryption keys change (device change, reinstallation, etc.)
- Performance impact of encrypting all notifications needs to be assessed
- Need to ensure backward compatibility with existing messages
- Consider adding message integrity verification beyond the checksum
