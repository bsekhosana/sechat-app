# Feature: Replace Invitation Feature With Request Key Exchange

## Objective
Replace the current invitation system with a key exchange request system that ensures all sensitive data (display names, profile info) is encrypted while maintaining the same user experience flow.

## Context
Currently, the app uses an invitation system where display names are sent in unencrypted push notification titles/bodies. This feature will replace that with a key exchange request system where:
- Only session IDs are used for routing
- All sensitive data is encrypted
- Key exchange happens automatically upon acceptance
- Contacts and chats are created automatically after successful key exchange

## Clarifying Q&A
- **Display Names**: Removed from push notification bodies, kept in encrypted data and UI
- **Key Exchange**: Automatic when accepted, continues with existing processKeyExchangeResponse
- **Contact Creation**: Uses session ID + encrypted display names
- **Chat Creation**: Automatic on both sides, with rollback on failure
- **Data Encryption**: Everything except session ID (which AirNotifier needs for routing)
- **UI**: Similar to invitations but with "R.Key Exch" terminology
- **Error Handling**: Rollback everything and alert users, with retry mechanisms
- **Existing Data**: Remove all invitations, start fresh

## Reusability Notes
- Reuses existing KeyExchangeService and EncryptionService
- Reuses existing notification infrastructure
- Reuses existing contact and chat models
- New UI components can be reused for other request-based features

  - [x] Update all related text and labels
  - [x] Maintain sent/received tabs structure
- [x] Implement Encrypted Data Exchange
  - [x] Create encrypted payload with sender details
  - [x] Send encrypted notification after key exchange
  - [x] Process encrypted data on recipient side
- [x] Implement Automatic Contact/Chat Creation
  - [x] Create contact on both sides
  - [x] Create chat on both sides
  - [x] Send encrypted response with recipient data
  - [x] Handle creation failures with rollback
- [x] Update Message Sending
  - [x] Ensure display names never appear in notification titles/bodies
  - [x] Encrypt all sensitive data
  - [x] Only use session IDs for routing
- [x] Remove Old Invitation System
  - [x] Delete old invitation files
  - [x] Remove old invitation references (partially completed)
  - [x] Remove invitation method calls from switch statement
  - [x] Remove invitation method definitions (partially completed)
  - [x] Identified all remaining invitation methods for removal
  - [x] Complete removal of remaining invitation methods (MANUAL CLEANUP COMPLETED)
- [ ] Testing and Validation
  - [ ] Test complete flow end-to-end
  - [ ] Verify encryption is working
  - [ ] Test error scenarios and rollback
