# Background Notification Fix

## Problem
Push notifications are not showing when the app is in the background, even though messages are being received and processed.

## Root Cause Analysis
From the logs, I can see:
1. Message is received while app is paused (line 858-862 in logs)
2. Message is processed and saved to database
3. No push notification is shown
4. No notification service logs appear

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Notification Service Initialization

**File**: `lib/main.dart`
- Added proper initialization of `LocalNotificationBadgeService` in main app startup
- Added initialization check in message received callback

**Changes**:
```dart
// Initialize the notification service first
await localNotificationBadgeService.initialize();

// Ensure notification service is initialized
await localNotificationBadgeService.initialize();
```

### 2. Enhanced Background Connection Manager

**File**: `lib/core/services/background_connection_manager.dart`
- Added notification service initialization when app goes to background
- Ensures notification service is ready for background notifications

**Changes**:
```dart
// Initialize notification service for background notifications
try {
  final notificationService = LocalNotificationBadgeService();
  await notificationService.initialize();
  Logger.success('üîß BackgroundConnectionManager: ‚úÖ Notification service initialized for background');
} catch (e) {
  Logger.error('üîß BackgroundConnectionManager: ‚ùå Error initializing notification service: $e');
}
```

### 3. Enhanced Notification Service Debugging

**File**: `lib/features/notifications/services/local_notification_badge_service.dart`
- Added comprehensive logging to track notification flow
- Added notification channel existence check
- Added notification permission check
- Enhanced app lifecycle detection

**Key Changes**:
```dart
// Enhanced logging
Logger.info('üì± LocalNotificationBadgeService: üîî Attempting to show message notification: $title');
Logger.debug('üì± LocalNotificationBadgeService: üîç App in background: $isBackground');

// Channel existence check
await _ensureNotificationChannelExists('message_notifications');

// Permission check
final areNotificationsEnabled = await _localNotifications.resolvePlatformSpecificImplementation<
    AndroidFlutterLocalNotificationsPlugin>()?.areNotificationsEnabled();
```

### 4. Added Notification Channel Management

**New Method**: `_ensureNotificationChannelExists()`
- Checks if notification channel exists before showing notification
- Creates channel if it doesn't exist
- Prevents notification failures due to missing channels

## Expected Behavior

### Before Fix
- ‚ùå No push notifications when app is in background
- ‚ùå Messages received but no visual notification
- ‚ùå Silent message processing

### After Fix
- ‚úÖ Push notifications show when app is in background
- ‚úÖ Visual notifications for incoming messages
- ‚úÖ Proper contact names in notification titles
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive logging for debugging

## Testing Steps

1. **Send message while app is in foreground** - Should show notification
2. **Send message while app is in background** - Should show notification
3. **Check notification logs** - Should see notification service logs
4. **Verify contact names** - Should show proper contact names, not session IDs

## Debugging

### Key Log Messages to Watch
```
üì± LocalNotificationBadgeService: üîî Attempting to show message notification
üì± LocalNotificationBadgeService: üîç App in background: true/false
üì± LocalNotificationBadgeService: üîî Showing notification with ID
üì± LocalNotificationBadgeService: ‚úÖ Message notification shown
```

### Common Issues
1. **Service not initialized** - Check for initialization logs
2. **Channel not created** - Check for channel creation logs
3. **Permissions denied** - Check for permission request logs
4. **App lifecycle detection** - Check for background state detection

## Files Modified

### Primary Changes
- **`lib/main.dart`**: Added notification service initialization
- **`lib/core/services/background_connection_manager.dart`**: Added background notification initialization
- **`lib/features/notifications/services/local_notification_badge_service.dart`**: Enhanced debugging and channel management

### Supporting Infrastructure
- **Notification channels**: Ensured proper creation and management
- **Permission handling**: Added permission checks and requests
- **Logging**: Enhanced debugging capabilities

## Next Steps

1. **Test the current implementation** - Send messages while app is in background
2. **Check logs** - Verify notification service is being called
3. **Verify permissions** - Ensure Android notification permissions are granted
4. **Test contact name resolution** - Verify proper contact names in notifications

## Notes
- The notification service now initializes both at app startup and when going to background
- Enhanced logging will help identify any remaining issues
- Channel management ensures notifications can be displayed
- Permission checks ensure notifications are allowed by the system
