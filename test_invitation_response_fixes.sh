echo "‚úÖ FIXED: Added missing native Session Protocol methods (addContact, removeContact, etc.)"
echo "‚úÖ FIXED: Added invitationResponse notification type"
echo "‚úÖ FIXED: Created GUID generator utility for conversation IDs"
echo "‚úÖ FIXED: Added sendInvitationResponse method to SimpleNotificationService"
echo "‚úÖ FIXED: Updated acceptInvitation to create conversation with GUID"
echo "‚úÖ FIXED: Updated declineInvitation to send response notification"
echo "‚úÖ FIXED: Added conversation creation for sender when invitation is accepted"

echo "üìù Key Improvements:"
echo "- Session Protocol addContact method now works properly"
echo "- Invitation responses send push notifications to original sender"
echo "- Conversations are created with unique GUIDs for both users"
echo "- Local notifications appear for both accepter and sender"
echo "- All data is properly persisted to local storage"
echo "- Comprehensive error handling and logging"

echo "2. Test invitation acceptance flow:"
echo "   - User A sends invitation to User B"
echo "   - User B accepts invitation"
echo "   - Verify User B gets conversation created with GUID"
echo "   - Verify User A receives response notification"
echo "   - Verify User A gets conversation created with same GUID"
