## üîß **Step 3: Flutter Wireless Debugging Commands**

### **List Wireless Devices:**
```bash
flutter devices
```

### **Run App Wirelessly:**
```bash
# Run on wireless iPhone
flutter run -d <DEVICE_ID>

# Or run on all devices
flutter run
```

### **Install App Wirelessly:**
```bash
# Install debug version
flutter install

# Install release version
flutter install --release
```

### **Hot Reload/Restart:**
```bash
# In the terminal where flutter run is active:
# Press 'r' for hot reload
# Press 'R' for hot restart
# Press 'q' to quit
```

## üöÄ **Step 4: Quick Setup Commands**

### **Complete iOS Wireless Setup:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Setting up iOS wireless debugging..."

# 1. Check if Xcode is installed
if ! command -v xcodebuild &> /dev/null; then
    echo "‚ùå Xcode not found. Please install Xcode from App Store."
    exit 1
fi

# 2. Open Xcode workspace
echo "Opening Xcode workspace..."
open ios/Runner.xcworkspace

# 3. Check Flutter devices
echo "Checking available devices..."
flutter devices

# 4. Instructions for manual setup
echo ""
echo "üì± Manual Setup Required:"
echo "1. In Xcode: Window > Devices and Simulators"
echo "2. Select your iPhone"
echo "3. Check 'Connect via network'"
echo "4. Disconnect USB cable"
echo "5. Verify device shows as 'Connected via network'"
echo ""
echo "Then run: flutter run"
```

### **Save and Run:**
```bash
chmod +x setup_ios_wireless.sh
./setup_ios_wireless.sh
```

## üîç **Step 5: Troubleshooting iOS Wireless Debugging**

### **Issue 1: Device Not Showing as Wireless**
**Solution:**
1. Ensure iPhone is connected via USB first
2. In Xcode: **Window > Devices and Simulators**
3. Select iPhone and check **"Connect via network"**
4. Wait for "Connected via network" status
5. Disconnect USB cable

### **Issue 2: Flutter Can't Find Wireless Device**
**Solution:**
```bash
# Restart Flutter daemon
flutter daemon --shutdown
flutter doctor

# Check devices again
flutter devices

# If still not working, restart Xcode and reconnect
```

### **Issue 3: Connection Lost**
**Solution:**
1. Check both devices are on same WiFi
2. Reconnect via USB and re-enable wireless
3. Restart Xcode if needed
4. Try different WiFi network

### **Issue 4: Code Signing Issues**
**Solution:**
1. In Xcode: **Runner > Signing & Capabilities**
2. Select your **Team** (Apple ID)
3. Check **"Automatically manage signing"**
4. Clean and rebuild:
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter build ios
```
