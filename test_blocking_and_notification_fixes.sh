echo "üß™ Testing Instructions:"
echo "1. Build and install the app:"
echo "   flutter build apk --debug && flutter install"
echo ""
echo "2. Test blocking functionality:"
echo "   - Receive an invitation from another user"
echo "   - Block the user from the invitation"
echo "   - Verify the invitation status changes to 'blocked'"
echo "   - Verify the invitation remains for reference"
echo "   - Verify the user is blocked via Session Protocol"
echo ""
echo "3. Test notification independence:"
echo "   - Receive an invitation (creates notification)"
echo "   - Delete the invitation"
echo "   - Verify the notification still exists"
echo "   - Verify notifications are only deleted manually"
echo ""
echo "4. Expected debug output for blocking:"
echo "   - 'Blocking user via Session ID: [sessionId]'"
echo "   - 'User removed via Session Protocol: [sessionId]'"
echo "   - 'User blocked successfully: [sessionId]'"
echo ""
echo "5. Expected debug output for invitation deletion:"
echo "   - 'Deleted invitation [id] and saved to local storage (notifications preserved)'"

echo "6. Expected behavior:"
echo "   - Blocking users works via Session ID"
echo "   - Invitations remain for reference when blocked"
echo "   - Notifications persist independently"
